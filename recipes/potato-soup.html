    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        An easy and delicious creamy potato soup recipe that can be made in just one pot! Loaded with bacon and creamy
        potato goodness, this is a favorite comfort food in my household.
    </p>
    <p>
        Savory, creamy, and loaded with bacon, sour cream, and cheese. You guys already know that we don’t exactly do
        health food around here, right? 😉
    </p>
    <p>
        Even when I’m not sharing desserts, the food is always comfort food, and that’s usually best served with extra
        cheese (have you tried my baked mac and cheese yet!?) and usually comes with a few calories. Let’s not think
        about that too much, alright?
    </p>
    <p>
        I know I mentioned to you guys that I had this potato soup recipe for you back when I posted my Oreo Balls; I
        made it when Zach had a bad cold and I haven’t stopped thinking about it since (you might think that’s an
        exaggeration, but I can assure you that my food obsessions run deep.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 strips (uncooked) bacon cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons butter unsalted or salted will work</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion chopped (about 1.5 cup/200g)</li>
        <li>3 large garlic cloves minced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour (42g)</li>
        <li>
            2 ½ lbs gold potatoes peeled and diced into pieces no larger than 1” (this was about 6 Large potatoes for
            me/1.15kg)
        </li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth (945ml)</li>
        <li>2 cups milk (475ml)</li>
        <li>⅔ cup heavy cream (155ml)</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoon* salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
        <li>¼ - ½ teaspoon ancho chili powder**</li>
        <li>⅔ cup sour cream (160g)</li>
        <li>Shredded cheddar cheese, chives, and additional sour cream and bacon for topping optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place bacon pieces in a large Dutch Oven or soup pot over medium heat and cook until bacon is crisp and
            browned.
        </li>
        <li>Remove bacon pieces and set aside, leaving the fat in the pot.</li>
        <li>Add butter and chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onions are tender (3-5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the flour over the ingredients in the pot and stir until smooth (use whisk if needed).</li>
        <li>
            Add diced potatoes to the pot along with chicken broth, milk, heavy cream, salt, pepper, and ancho chili
            powder. Stir well.
        </li>
        <li>Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork (about 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>
            Reduce heat to simmer and remove approximately half*** of the soup to a blender (be careful, it will be
            hot!) and puree until smooth (half is about 5 cups of soup, but just eyeballing the amount will be fine.
            Alternatively you can use an immersion blender.).
        </li>
        <li>Return the pureed soup to the pot and add sour cream and reserved bacon pieces, stir well.</li>
        <li>Allow soup to simmer for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Top with additional sour cream, bacon, cheddar cheese, or chives. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
